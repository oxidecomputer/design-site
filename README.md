## Contributing

### Project setup

```{sh}
npm install
```

### Project layout

/public

The `public` directory contains all of the static assets for the website including
the `index.html` file where the vue instance and templates get injected.

/src

The `src` directory contains all of the source code for the website including the
reusable vue components, compiled assets (css,img,js), and views. Currently there
is only a single view (Home), but the inclusion of a timeline feature could utilize
the vue router and other view pages.

/docs

The `docs` directory contains misc files for developers/designers so that they
are available to all while still being maintained under source control.

/dist

The `dist` directory is generated by running `npm run build` and contains all of
the compiled files to be deployed for the production version of the website.

### Local environment variables

```sh
.env                # loaded in all cases
.env.local          # loaded in all cases, ignored by git
.env.[mode]         # only loaded in specified mode
.env.[mode].local   # only loaded in specified mode, ignored by git
```

See the [docs](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html#environment-variables)
for more information on how the environment variables are loaded.

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```{sh}
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```{sh}
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```{sh}
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Deploying

The site is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) so we get
[previews of changes in PRs](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/).

> This idea was based off something a team at
> [Microsoft](https://microsoft.github.io/join-dev-design/) did as well :)
