We are looking for designers who code to help build a new user experience for computing!

Interested? Send a PR with any improvement to this repo on GitHub or [apply through our careers page](https://oxide.computer/careers/product-engineering/).

## Contributing

### Running locally

Install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Run `hugo serve` to automatically update as you make changes. This will output
the url to the browser.

Or you can use `make serve`.

### Deploying

The site is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and we get previews of changes in PRs.

## Prior Art

This idea was based off something a team at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.github.io/join-dev-design/) did as well :)
