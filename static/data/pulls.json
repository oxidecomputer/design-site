But to make sure we ain't scaring people away let's default to the known dark mode 😄 \r\n\r\n- [x] ColorThemeSwitch which defaults to dark and saves it's settings to `localStorage` for recurring visits\r\n\r\n**What did change?**\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix some minor typography and responsiveness issues \r\n- [x] Abstract the CSS color definition a little bit to make it more themeable and also use vars instead of hardcoded colors across the css\r\n- [x] Inline JS Code was moved from HTML to the js file\r\n\r\n**What's in the pipeline/missing?**\r\n\r\n- [x] The Logo is a PNG and I'd like to avoid creating a second one for the `light mode` - any chance I could get an SVG version of the logo @jessfraz? (otherwise I go with the PNG approach)\r\n- [ ] I'd potentially like to rewrite it as a react app since it would enable us to create reusable components and many more things - but I guess we'd need @jessfraz commitment on this ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior/visual look?**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"978\" alt=\"Before\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132332/70472767-f89fdc00-1acf-11ea-9894-57edc7b36eab.png\">\r\n\r\n**What is the new behavior/visual look?**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"978\" alt=\"After - Dark Mode\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132332/70472804-0c4b4280-1ad0-11ea-8154-8a2b2191cd39.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"978\" alt=\"After - Light Mode\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132332/70472840-1bca8b80-1ad0-11ea-92f4-cfd5e8d51ae8.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n- [ ] Tests (ouch...)\r\n- [ ] Ready to be merged",
